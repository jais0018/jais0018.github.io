        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <article>
        <p>Greetings, my name is Akash Jaison. I am enrolled in the interactive media design program at my college, which is highly regarded. Currently, I am in my initial semester.</p>
       <p>In 2020, before coming to Canada, I successfully completed my 12<sup>th</sup> grade. My aspiration has always been to become a game designer.
        Consequently, I faced a dilemma regarding whether to pursue a program aligned with my 12th grade education or opt for a new program that would
        equip me with the necessary skills to pursue my dream career as a game designer.</p>
